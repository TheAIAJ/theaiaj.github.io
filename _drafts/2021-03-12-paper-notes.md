title: Notes on Papers
---

- Write one line per sentence, makes it easier to see long sentences

- Self-referential layout, abstract -> sections -> paragraphs -> sentences

- Make the introduction about the layout of the paper but subtly, don't have a pointer paragraph at the end of it. Instead, use a key contributions of this paper paragraph.

- booktabs for tables

- non breaking space between text and cite/ref

- ensure figures are referenced in the text and pull their weight
